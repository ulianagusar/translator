These countries owe much of their successful economic development to investment in a diverse range of assets, including “intangible” assets such as institutions, education, and business enterprise.
These drawbacks result in high under-execution rates for public investments with many unfinished or delayed projects and significantly higher costs.
These have to improve for cities to be more environmentally friendly and attract a young, urban population who will play a key part in driving the economy in the future.
These hurdles have hindered the private sector’s chance to grow, as reflected in the largely stagnant structure of the country’s industry and exports, low levels of industrial productivity, low inflow of high value-added foreign direct investments, especially in export-oriented manufacturing, and the relatively limited role of SMEs in the economy.
